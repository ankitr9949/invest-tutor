        <h2 class="corange ">What Is Debt?</h2>
        <p>

            Debt is something, usually money, borrowed by one party from another. Debt is used by many corporations and individuals to make large purchases that they could not afford under normal circumstances. A debt arrangement gives the borrowing party permission
            to borrow money under the condition that it is to be paid back at a later date, usually with interest. Debt instruments represent a loan from which you expect to receive a return of your principal with interest, such as a bank certificate
            of deposit or a municipal bond. In some cases debt instruments can also produce a capital gain or loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            The federal government provides the safest place for your debt investments through the sale of Treasury bonds, bills, notes and other government-backed securities, because the interest and principal are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
            States government. The difference between these debt securities involves their maturity dates. Treasury notes might mature in a few days, while Treasury bills have varying maturity dates ranging from two to 10 years. Treasury bonds extend
            for 30 years. The interest on U.S. Treasury bonds, bills and notes is exempt from state income tax but is taxable on your federal income tax return.
        </p>
        <h2 class="corange ">What Is a Bond?</h2>
        <p>
            A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments.
            Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.
        </p>
        <h2 class="corange ">The Issuers of Bonds</h2>
        <p>

            Governments (at all levels) and corporations commonly use bonds in order to borrow money. Governments need to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure. The sudden expense of war may also demand the need to raise funds. Similarly, corporations
            will often borrow to grow their business, to buy property and equipment, to undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or to hire employees. The problem that large organizations run into is that they typically need far more
            money than the average bank can provide. Bonds provide a solution by allowing many individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Indeed, public debt markets let thousands of investors each lend a portion of the capital needed. Moreover,
            markets allow lenders to sell their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individualsâ€”long after the original issuing organization raised capital.
